# spotify-search-siri-shortcut
A shortcut for Apple's Siri Shortcuts that lets you initiate a Spotify search using your voice.

### Requirements
- iOS 12 with Shortcuts app installed
- Spotify app

### Limitations
- You must unlock your iOS device when triggering the shortcut. This is unavoidable.
- The resulting search in the Spotify app will have "+" characters where spaces should be. The Spotify app seems to reject the request when spaces are used. For now at least, the search works as normal.
- The shortcut only initiates a search, and cannot select a result or autoplay a track for you.

# Installing
To install this shortcut, [download the release](https://github.com/nbolender/spotify-search-siri-shortcut/releases/download/v1.0.0/SearchSpotify.shortcut) from your iOS device and choose to open it in the Shortcuts app. This will add the shortcut to your library and make it available for use.

## Alternatives
If you have voice control available in your Spotify account, you can use the shortcut created by Reddit user randybruder to open Spotify and trigger the voice assistant: [Discusssion on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/9gzhk9/launch_spotify_right_into_the_voice_control/) | [Screenshot of workflow](https://i.imgur.com/S0ErDJl.png)
